# NewtonRaph
Newton Raphson Method on matlab
<br/><br/>

## Basic Idea
The algorithm of this code is based on

## Discription
 * First
   > Get Function _**y=f(x)**_   
   > and Differentiate _**f(x)**_  
 
 * Second  
   > Set _**error**, **maximum iteration**_ and _**initial X**_   
   
 * Third   
  
   Program will  in 3 situations.
   + First, when error is bigger than lastest one.
   + Second, when the error value converge to the error value you set
   + Third, when the number of iteration reaches to number you set

## Others..   
 * I made this code to do my college assignment.   
   After making this, I compare mine with [the codes](https://kr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/68885-the-newton-raphson-method) that uploaded at Mathworks homepage.   
   And then, I thought,   
   > _"oh shit, my code is more **user friendly** than uploaded codes."_  
   > 
   > **(Actually, it's not. Just my opinion)** 
      
  * I am hoping that my code can help other undergraduate students' assignments
